# How do you come to Amsterdam?

## By car

If you come by car, we recommend you to use a P+R parking. They are on the outskirts of the city. You can park your car for only €1 per 24 hours (max 96hours). The only condition: your return journey to the parking MUST be by public transport, and the last check in (or changeover) must take place in the city centre area. All information can be found <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/parking/park-and-ride/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<br/>

Almost in the center, a parking option is <a href="https://parkereninijdock.nl/en/" target="_blank">IJdock car park</a>. When booking online in advance it’s €10 per 24 hours, and €30 without booking. <br/><br/>

Parking is complicated and expensive in the city center. But some place are free at night or on Sunday. If you want to check the rates/times for street parking <a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/en/parking/on-street-parking/" target="_blank">check here</a>.

<br/>

## By train

From Paris and Bruxelles especially the Thalys is a brilliant option, you arrive right in the center of Amsterdam. The ticket sales opens 4 month before the travel date, be on time to get the best prices! <br/><br/>

The Netherlands has a very well developed train system, if you decide to visit Rotterdam, Utrecht or other cities before coming to Amsterdam, the train is definitely worth it.

<br/>

## By plane

Amsterdam Schiphol is a very good airport. You can reach the city from the airport by train, bus or Uber. Depending where you’re going.<br/>
By train it takes 15 to 20 minutes to Amsterdam Centraal. It’s also possible to go to other stations like Amsterdam Sloterdijk, Amsterdam Zuid, Amsterdam Lelylaan, Amsterdam Amstel, etc. Costs: 4.5euros +  1 euro surcharge for a disposable ticket. Schiphol’s train station is located directly underneath the airport. <br/><br/>
