So we'll have hand sanitizer and increase social distance as much as possible. The venue will respect the measures required. We personally will hug who wants to hug but are also fine with greeting each other with a Namasté sign or an elbow check. Also if you want to wear a mask you are very welcome. If we need to do more we will. And if you have any suggestions please let us know.",
